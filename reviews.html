            <p>"I did a lot of research before switching to Bonsai from another invoicing service. The ability to send and sign contracts was a game changer for me. No one else offers such a seamless process from proposal to contract to invoice. It has saved me a lot of time and lets me focus on creative work."</p>

            <p>"I've been a Bonsai user for years. It has allowed me to grow my career as a fulltime freelancer especially with the ease of making contracts and collecting payments. With a variety of clients that are all on different payment schedules, Bonsai provided options for each client without difficulty. Now I am enjoying Bonsai even more that they have added the additional accounting and tax assistance. This quarter I was able to save so much more time filing quarterly tax payments thanks to the tax assistance feature. Thanks, Bonsai for understanding what freelancers need at every stage of their freelance career."</p>

            <p>"Bonsai has been absolutely essential in taking my freelance work from an amateur side-gig to a full-time business. It pays for itself 2x over in the time I save having everything so seamlessly integrated. I love how I'm able to send professional-looking invoices, track billable and non-billable hours, create to-do lists, track finances/expenses, and even create contracts and proposals all in one place. The integration with Google Calendar is a huge plus, the customer service is beyond stellar, the platform is really intuitive and easy to use... Really can't say enough good things about it."</p>

            <p>"We started a new venture to provide digital services to small businesses. Bonsai helped fast track our operations right away. We built upon contract and proposal templates and were able to streamline our operations, as if we were already operating for years. Our clients have all been very impressed with our operations, and we owe a lot of that satisfaction to Bonsai. Thanks! A+ from the Promethean team."</p>

            <p>"Bonsai is the best way to consolidate the “other” side of being in business as a freelancer or independent operator. That is what I love about it; proposals, contracts, invoices - all managed under the same umbrella. This alone has provided a great and streamlined experience for my clients. Bonsai is my armor to get what I’m worth. How I benefit most from Bonsai is having a reliable system to scale the pieces required in order to sustain my practice :)"</p>

Invoices, proposals, etc they all provide the same level of professionalism I already offer my client."</p>
